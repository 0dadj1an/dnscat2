- Make it possible to change the DNS types
- Make it possible to change the DNS server
- Make non-console drivers work
- Add the option to adjust the retransmit delay
- Figure out when the best time is to exit()
- Make packet_trace work again
- Go through the commandline options and make sure each of them works
  again
- Change how sub-protocols work - have a flag then a protocol ID, probably, would make life far less confusing
- The client should transmit new data immediately after receiving data
- Make it possible to close sessions on both ends using ctrl-d
- The 'sessions' command should display all sessions, not just sub-sessions
- Kill the process when a driver_exec session is destroyed
- Add a 'proper' way to kill drivers to controller.c, and make sure all closing/killing goes through that
- The server needs to respond to PING packets' id field
- I can probably get rid of poll_for_data() by exposing another function or two to drivers
- Make controller_add_session() happen automatically in the sessions's constructor
