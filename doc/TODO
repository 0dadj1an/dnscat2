Immediate needs:
- Proper synchronization (mutexes)
- Rename the appropriate classes in the server to 'driver'
- Add/improve commandline arguments for dnscat server
- Ignore packets with repeated packet id values
- Add a -e / --exec option
- Create a consistent "log" class for the client
- TEST on Linux :: Catch ctrl-c and send a FIN
- Client should give up after a certain number of failed SYNs
- Client needs to process packets differently - the driver should immediately
  hand the packet to the session, and the session should manage how and when to
  send them


Future stuff:
- Other protocols (ping/http/etc)
- Signing/encryption
- Compression
- SOCKS/HTTP proxy
