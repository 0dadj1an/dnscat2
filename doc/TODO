Immediate needs:
- Client should give up after a certain number of failed SYNs or MSGs
- Implement other DNS types (A, AAAA, CNAME, etc)
- Handle DNS errors properly
- Get tab completion on server working properly
- Client should automatically terminate if it can't find a server
- Choose better default names for each driver
- Add more debugging messages throughout, especially newer functionality
- Make a server-size state for 'exception' (in addition to closed/idle/etc)
- Implement 'control mode' on the client
- Take a look at the tcp/udp send/recv functions that return ssize_t to make sure the signedness is handled correctly
- Look at places where long-term buffers can be cleaned up (ie, so they don't keep growing)
- Check max length values for packet sizes and such
- Go through all the structs to figure out which members are no longer used
- Go through and try to initialize all pointers to NULL
- Refactor UiSession.rb so it can be re-used for other session types
- Handle command sessions receiving bad data more gracefully on the client side

UI stuff:
- ctrl-c signal on all OSes
- ctrl-z on rvmsudo
- Error message if port 53 fails
- Error message if no dns server can be found

Future stuff:
- Other protocols (ping/http/etc)
- Signing/encryption
- Compression
