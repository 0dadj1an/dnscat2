Immediate needs:
- TEST on Linux :: Catch ctrl-c and send a FIN
- Client should give up after a certain number of failed SYNs or MSGs
- Implement other DNS types (A, AAAA, CNAME, etc)
- Handle DNS errors properly
- Get tab completion on Ruby working properly
- Client should automatically terminate if it can't find a server
- Implement 'control mode' on the client
- Choose better default names for each driver
- Add a 'kill' command
- Windows support
- Add more debugging messages throughout, especially newer functionality
- Make a server-size state for 'exception' (in addition to closed/idle/etc)
- Add an optional 'reason' field to FIN packets

Future stuff:
- Other protocols (ping/http/etc)
- Signing/encryption
- Compression
