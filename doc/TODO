Immediate needs:
- Proper synchronization (mutexes)
- Ignore packets with repeated packet id values
- TEST on Linux :: Catch ctrl-c and send a FIN
- Client should give up after a certain number of failed SYNs
- Implement other DNS types (A, AAAA, CNAME, etc)

Future stuff:
- Other protocols (ping/http/etc)
- Signing/encryption
- Compression
- SOCKS/HTTP proxy
