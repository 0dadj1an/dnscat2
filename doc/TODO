Immediate needs:
- Proper synchronization (mutexes)
- Client isn't validating the response from recv() properly (if you ctrl-c the server, the client aborts)
- Rename the appropriate classes in the server to 'driver'
- Change the DNS class to use size_t when appropriate
- If the initial SYN response gets lost, the server never recovers

Future stuff:
- Other protocols (ping/http/etc)
- Signing/encryption
- Compression
- SOCKS/HTTP proxy
