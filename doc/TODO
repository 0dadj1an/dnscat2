Immediate needs:
- Proper synchronization (mutexes)
- TEST on Linux :: Catch ctrl-c and send a FIN
- Client should give up after a certain number of failed SYNs
- Implement other DNS types (A, AAAA, CNAME, etc)
- Handle DNS errors properly
- Get names working properly again
- Get tab completion on Ruby working properly
- Display how long a session has been idle for on the server
- Client should automatically terminate if it can't find a server
- Figure out a sub-protocol for transferring files
- Implement 'control mode' on the client
- Choose better default names for each driver
- Add a 'kill' command
- Automatically map incoming sessions to easier (incremental) numbers on the server

Future stuff:
- Other protocols (ping/http/etc)
- Signing/encryption
- Compression
