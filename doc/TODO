Immediate needs:
- Proper synchronization (mutexes)
- Add/improve commandline arguments for dnscat server
- Ignore packets with repeated packet id values
- Add a -e / --exec option
- TEST on Linux :: Catch ctrl-c and send a FIN
- Client should give up after a certain number of failed SYNs
- Implement other DNS types (A, AAAA, CNAME, etc)
- Move the 'ui' stuff into session rather than being in the driver

Future stuff:
- Other protocols (ping/http/etc)
- Signing/encryption
- Compression
- SOCKS/HTTP proxy
