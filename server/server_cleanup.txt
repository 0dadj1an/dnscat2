Some goals (these will be deleted as I complete them):
- Take care of all TODOs that are possible
- Improve the logging so I don't need 2 logging windows per session
- Make it possible to start/stop tunnel drivers again

Before release, make sure:
- Make sure all the commandline settings and other settings work
- Make sure everything works over normal DNS
- Make sure everything works on Windows
- Update documentation / output / etc.

Out of scope things that I'd like to do eventually (so I'll file them as github issues):
- Add a command to command sessions to spawn a console session (--console), if that's possible
- Nested sessions
- Figure out if I actually need to include the domain name
- Write tests for the connection/session stuff
