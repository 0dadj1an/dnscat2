Some goals (these will be deleted as I complete them):
- Nested sessions
- Make sure a good error is still displayed when the user doesn't run it as root
- Make @window.puts_ex use named parameters everywhere
- Take care of all TODOs that are possible
- Make sure all of the commands from the original version are present in the cleaned up version
- Make it possible to create/destroy tunnel drivers
- At the end of dnscat.rb, do SWindow.wait(), and when it returns (the input thread ends), the process should be cleanly terminated
- Implement 'help' command and '-h' arguments everywhere
- Audit all uses of "puts()" throughout the program to ensure none of them are supposed to be window.puts()
- Make sure all the settings and commands from pre-refactor are present
- Comment APIs really well, especially stuff in the /libs folder
- Make sure everything works over normal DNS
- Fix the id: Shell session created: 3171
- Limit history so we don't quickly run out of memory when logging packets and stuff
- Implement what I wrote in the server-exec branch

Add settings that can:
- Execute an arbitrary command (or send data?) when the session starts
- Pass one or more sessions to an executable rather than interacting with them directly
- Send a command to multiple sessions (all parents, all children, etc)
- Log to a file (per-session or global)
