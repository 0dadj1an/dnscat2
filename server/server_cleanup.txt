Some goals (these will be deleted as I complete them):
- Take care of all TODOs that are possible
- Bring back the "session last heard from [X] minutes ago" message
- Update documentation / output / etc.
- Figure out if I actually need to include the domain name
- Improve the logging so I don't need 2 logging windows per session
- Make it possible to start/stop tunnel drivers again

Before release, make sure:
- Make sure everything works over normal DNS

Out of scope things that I'd like to do eventually (so I'll file them as github issues):
- Add a command to command sessions to spawn a console session (--console), if that's possible
- Nested sessions
